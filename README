P2C1XThreads
============

C1X threads draft implementation as per
WG14 N1425 Draft 2009-11-24 ISO/IEC 9899:201x
http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1425.pdf
Using POSIX threads as backend

Please note: This was/is done for my own education and the fact that I don't
want to start new projects using whatever threading API when there is a standard
coming. So this project should be considered a bridging project to provide
myself (and maybe others) with a working C1X threads library, before the
standard is even here. Since the standard is not final and does not have much
documentation nor reference therefor and can still change consider this a draft
implementation that resembles the behavior of the upcoming C1X threads standard
but does not claim to be complete nor perfect ... does not even claim to be
correct! (The IEC draft documents do not make much remarks on the actual
behavior of some functions. In my opinion of course, it might make perfect sense
to someone else.)

In short it has issues but works for me (until the standard is final and a real
implementation is available, that is).

P.S. And it is a piggyback implementation on POSIX which the C1X threads.h is
an almost 1:1 binding. (The name of the project therefor means Pthreads to C1X
threads.)
